Currently pursuing a PhD in Industrial–Organizational Psychology, my work explores the human side of intelligent systems, how AI models simulate behavior, influence cognition, and alter the roles people play across organizational and operational domains.

I take a mix of humanistic and systems perspective on technology, combining behavioral science and strategic insight to understand how humans and machines co-shape outcomes. My research asks how we can align artificial intelligence within the **cognitive domain** the sphere of thought, perception, and decision to enhance clarity, resilience, and ethical design in complex environments.

Before academia, I served in the **United States Marine Corps (2nd Battalion, 7th Marines)**, later working in federal programs, nonprofits, and the private sector. That trajectory taught me to approach technology as both a human and strategic problem one where context, meaning, and purpose matter as much as capability.

Through **Delos Consulting**, I advise businesses and organizations on AI adoption, workforce transformation, and behavioral systems integration. My focus remains constant: creating structures that account for human complexity rather than optimizing for pure efficiency.

If you’re working where **psychology, AI, and strategy converge**, from defense research to cognitive modeling or ethical technology design, I’m always open to collaboration.
