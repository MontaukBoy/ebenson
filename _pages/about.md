I am a researcher and consultant focused on the psychological, behavioral, and strategic dimensions of artificial intelligence. My work explores how AI systems interact with human cognition, how they simulate behavior, influence perception, and reshape trust, identity, and decision-making across both organizational and national security environments.

Currently pursuing a **PhD in Industrial–Organizational Psychology**, my research bridges psychology, behavioral science, and systems design to understand how intelligent technologies alter the cognitive domain—the sphere where thought, emotion, and decision converge. I study how AI tools affect individual reasoning, institutional secrecy, and the psychological resilience of human systems operating under uncertainty.

Before academia, I served in the **United States Marine Corps (2nd Battalion, 7th Marines)** and later worked in federal programs, nonprofits, and the private sector. That path shaped my mission-oriented approach: to build systems that account for the complexity of people, not just the efficiency of processes. Through **Delos Consulting**, I advise organizations on AI adoption, workforce transformation, and cognitive security—integrating behavioral insight with technical strategy.

## Current Research Projects
- **The End of Secrets? AI’s Impact on National Security Secrecy and Personal Privacy** – Examines how AI surveillance and predictive analytics redefine the boundaries between classified control and individual privacy.  
- **Cognitive Bias in the Age of AI: Digital Nudging, Social Engineering, and the Battle for Autonomy** – Investigates how algorithmic systems exploit human bias and shape public perception.  
- **AI, Behavioral Simulation, and Trust in Secure Systems** – A cross-disciplinary review of how simulated agents and predictive models affect trust and reliability in mission-critical environments.  
- **Beyond Intelligence: Psychological and Existential Implications of AGI** – Explores how artificial general intelligence may alter human identity, motivation, and our collective sense of meaning.

Across all these projects, my central question remains:  
**How can we align intelligent systems with human purpose, preserving autonomy, ethics, and understanding in an age of algorithmic influence?**

If you’re working where **psychology, AI, and strategy** intersect, or on initiatives shaping the cognitive domain of future technology and security, I welcome collaboration and dialogue.
