## Research Focus
My work examines the intersection of **artificial intelligence, cognition, and human behavior**, with a focus on how intelligent systems influence perception, trust, and decision-making across both organizational and national security contexts.

At its core, my research explores how AI technologies reshape the **cognitive domain** — the space where thought, emotion, and belief interact to drive human action. I approach these questions through a multidisciplinary lens that blends psychology, systems thinking, and behavioral science to understand how algorithms not only model us but increasingly participate in our decision processes.

## Current and Ongoing Projects

**The End of Secrets? AI’s Impact on National Security Secrecy and Personal Privacy (2025–Present)**  
Explores how large-scale AI surveillance and predictive analytics are redefining secrecy in modern intelligence systems, eroding traditional boundaries between public transparency and classified control. The study examines ethical, operational, and psychological consequences for institutions and individuals navigating an era where privacy and national security interests are algorithmically intertwined.

**Cognitive Bias in the Age of AI: Digital Nudging, Social Engineering, and the Battle for Autonomy (2025–Present)**  
Analyzes how AI systems exploit or reinforce cognitive biases through recommendation engines, persuasive design, and synthetic media. This project investigates the psychological mechanisms behind digital influence operations and proposes frameworks for preserving human autonomy in environments shaped by algorithmic manipulation.

**AI, Behavioral Simulation, and Trust in Secure Systems: A Comprehensive Research Review (2025–Present)**  
A broad review synthesizing literature across psychology, cybersecurity, and AI ethics to evaluate how simulated agents and behavioral modeling tools influence trust calibration within secure or mission-critical systems. The work identifies design principles for ensuring transparency, reliability, and psychological safety in human-machine teams.

**Beyond Intelligence: Examining the Psychological and Existential Implications of AGI on Human Identity and Society (2025–Present)**  
A conceptual investigation into how artificial general intelligence challenges human notions of identity, agency, and consciousness. The project bridges cognitive psychology, philosophy of mind, and social theory to address how AGI may transform collective belief systems, purpose, and the boundaries of what it means to be human.

## Methodological Approach
I integrate **conceptual modeling, cognitive theory, and applied systems analysis** to investigate the behavioral impact of AI technologies.  
My methods combine elements of **Bayesian reasoning, experimental design, and qualitative synthesis**, guided by the principle that the mind, not the machine, remains the central variable in every system of intelligence.

The long-term aim of this research is to advance psychological understanding of human-AI interaction and to inform policy, defense strategy, and organizational design for a world increasingly mediated by algorithmic systems.
