Welcome! I‚Äôm a behavioral researcher and consultant exploring how **artificial intelligence interacts with the human mind**.  
My work investigates the cognitive, psychological, and strategic implications of AI systems how they model behavior, influence trust, and reshape decision-making across organizational and national security domains.

## Research Overview
I study human‚ÄìAI interaction within what‚Äôs often called the **cognitive domain** the contested space of perception, reasoning, and belief.  
My work combines industrial‚Äìorganizational psychology, cognitive science, and systems design to understand how intelligent technologies affect human autonomy and collective decision systems.

Current projects include:

- **The End of Secrets? AI‚Äôs Impact on National Security Secrecy and Personal Privacy**  
  How AI surveillance and predictive analytics redefine boundaries between transparency, secrecy, and individual privacy.

- **Cognitive Bias in the Age of AI: Digital Nudging, Social Engineering, and the Battle for Autonomy**  
  Examining how algorithms exploit cognitive bias and shape collective behavior in digital environments.

- **AI, Behavioral Simulation, and Trust in Secure Systems**  
  A research review exploring how behavioral modeling and agent-based systems influence trust calibration in mission-critical contexts.

- **Beyond Intelligence: Psychological and Existential Implications of AGI**  
  Investigating how artificial general intelligence challenges human identity, meaning, and psychological adaptation.

## About My Work
I bring a background that spans the **U.S. Marine Corps**, **federal service**, and **private sector consulting**, combining operational experience with psychological research.  
Through **Delos Consulting**, I help organizations align technology, ethics, and human performance integrating AI into workflows without losing the human element.

If your work touches **AI, psychology, or strategy**, or if you‚Äôre exploring the ethical frontiers of machine intelligence, I welcome collaboration and dialogue.
